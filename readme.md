# Dancing With Marty

A game build with Phaser JS for RTÃ‰.ie as part of the online coverage for Dancing with the Stars Ireland.

As it is a dancing show I chose to mimic the game play off Dance Dance Revolution but for mobile devices utilising swipe actions.

On desktop the game is controlled with the arrow key 

You can play it [here](https://www.rte.ie/dancing-with-marty/)
